### State-of-the-art nesting heuristic for 2D irregular strip packing
<p align="left">
    <img src="assets/sparrow_logo.png" alt="logo" height=100>
</p>

This optimization algorithm can be used to solve 2D irregular strip packing problems, also commonly referred to as nesting problems.
It builds on [`jagua-rs`](https://github.com/JeroenGar/jagua-rs): *a collision detection engine for 2D irregular cutting & packing problems*.

## Requirements
- Rust â‰¥ 1.85

This repository includes `jagua-rs` as a submodule.
Make sure it is initialized and up to date:
```bash
git submodule update --init
```

## Usage

General usage:
```bash
cargo run --release  -- \
    [path to input JSON] \
    [timelimit exploration phase in seconds]
```

Concrete example:
```bash
cargo run --release -- \
    libs/jagua-rs/assets/swim.json \
    120
```

To ensure maximum performance, compile with:
```bash
RUSTFLAGS='-C target-cpu=native'
```

If you want to monitor the optimization process live, open [assets/live/live_viewer.html](assets/live/live_viewer.html) in a web browser,
and compile with the `live_svg` feature enabled:

```bash
rm assets/live/.live_solution.svg
open assets/live/live_viewer.html
cargo run --release --features=live_svg -- \
    libs/jagua-rs/assets/swim.json \
    120
```

## Input

This repository uses the same JSON format as [`jagua-rs`](https://github.com/JeroenGar/jagua-rs) to represent instances.
These are also available in Oscar Oliveira's [OR-Datasets repository](https://github.com/Oscar-Oliveira/OR-Datasets/tree/master/Cutting-and-Packing/2D-Irregular).

See [`jagua-rs` README](https://github.com/JeroenGar/jagua-rs?tab=readme-ov-file#input) for details on the input format.

## Output

Solutions are exported as SVG files in `output` folder. The final SVG solutions is saved as `output/final_{name}.svg`.

The SVG files are both a visualization and formal output of a solution as all original shapes and their exact transformations applied to them are defined within the SVG:
```html
    ...
    <g id="items">
        <defs>
            <g id="item_0">...</g>
        </defs>
        <use transform="translate(1289.9116 1828.7717), rotate(-90)" xlink:href="#item_0">...</use>
    </g>
    ...
```
The [SVG spec](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18582935/the-applying-order-of-svg-transforms) defines that the transformations are applied from right to left.
So here the item is first rotated and then translated.

By default, a range of intermediate (and infeasible) solutions will be exported in `/output/sols_{name}`.
To disable this and export only a single final solution, enable the `only_final_svg` feature:
```bash
cargo run --release --features=only_final_svg -- \
    libs/jagua-rs/assets/swim.json \
    120
```

## Testing
The codebase contains a suite of `debug_assert!` checks to verify the correctness of the heuristic.
These assertions are omitted in release builds to maximize performance, but can be enabled by running the algorithm in the `debug-release` profile:
```bash
cargo run --profile debug-release -- \
    libs/jagua-rs/assets/swim.json \
    120
```

## Development

This repo is meant to remain a faithful representation of the algorithm described in [...].
Therefore, only pull requests containing performance improvements and bug fixes will be accepted.
Feel free to fork the repository if you want to experiment with different heuristics.
